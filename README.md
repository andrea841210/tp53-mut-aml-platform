# TP53-mut AML Platform

This repository demonstrates a modular strategy to identify rewiring vulnerabilities in TP53-mutated AML using multi-source datasets.

Modules:
- Node-1: Drug-pathway candidate screening (GDSC, DepMap, DrugBank)
- Node-2: RNA-seq + proxy assays for high-dimensional convergence
- Demo link: [insert Google Sheet / Slide link here]
